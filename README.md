# Number Increment

**The *"Number Incrementer"* program is a tool that allows you to generate a sequence of numbers and save them to a .txt file.**

## Technologies
![Python](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=python)

## How To Use
1. Clone the repository.
``` 
git clone https://github.com/LucianoGriffa/numberIncrement-python/
```
2. Enter the folder.
```
cd numberIncrement-python
```
3. Run the file ``count.py``.
```
python count.py
```
- When you run the program, you will be prompted to enter a starting integer (numberIni) and an ending integer (numberEnd).
- Make sure to enter the starting number less than the ending number, *otherwise you will get an error message*.
- Once the numbers are entered correctly, the program will generate a sequence of numbers from the start number to the end number (excluding the end number).
- Each number in the sequence will be saved in a file called "totalCount.txt". **If the file does not exist, it will be created automatically**.
- You can open the **"totalCount.txt"** file to see the generated sequence of numbers.
